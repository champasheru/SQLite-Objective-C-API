# Objective C API for SQLite
This is an Objective C API to interact with the SQLite Databases. It essentially shields all the low level C rountines &amp; functions and provides a clean &amp; consistent API through Objective C.

I have used this library in 2-3 iOS apps which are pretty critical and robust in nature, as such it's a proven one.
One can use it in Mac OS X or iOS app or anywhere one needs Objective C bindings for SQLite. 
In case of Apple platforms, if one doesn't want to use Core Data (due toreasons like maitaining different versions of DB schemas at the same time or for reason owing to design/implementation) and escape from low level C API, then this is precise fit.

I will try to provide the code snippets pretty soon to demonstrate the usage and to get a gist of it.
